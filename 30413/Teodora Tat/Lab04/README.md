# Lab 04
Firstly I created the tree (I used a function to take the data directly from the file and then created it) then I did the functions of 
printing the tree in the three ways (inorder, preorder, postorder) 
Then I made a function for counting the nr of leaves (if the right and the left "child" is 0 then the node is a leaf)
Then I made a simple function for switching two nodes, then a function for searching a certain node by a given key
Then I made a recursive function calculating the height (with the help of the a function that calculates the maximum of two numbers to help 
finding the side of the children of the root with the bigger height and so on.)
