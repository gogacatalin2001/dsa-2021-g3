# Lab 04

> discussed the proper algorithms for lab3 extra problems, and the bigO (the elemntary complexities). Talked about trees, traversals, nr of leaves, etc.

->Mandatory: for  interchanging left and right subtrees i implemented a "find" function which returns the node with the asked 
key, which i used in the "interchange" func. In this function, i just copied the ->left in a Aux and swapped them.
For the height of the tree i used a similar approach with the "leaves" problem you presented in the lab, (recursively 
calculating the height of the left and right subtrees), returning at each step the maximum between them.
